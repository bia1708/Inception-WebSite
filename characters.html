                <p>Dominick Cobb is the best Extractor in the game, as he is hired by corporations to steal secrets they would otherwise never have access to. His level of expertise is such that he is very well-known in the black market of individuals who
                    are able to infiltrate people’s minds and extract information.<br> Dom Cobb is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film. Both Brad Pitt and Will Smith were offered the role, according to The
                    Hollywood Reporter. Cobb's role is compared to <i>"the haunted widower in a Gothic romance"</i>.<br>

                <p>Arthur is Dominick Cobb's right-hand man. Although Cobb is the master planner, Arthur takes care of the details, does the research, and makes sure everything is right. Sharing dreams is not just a job for him; he finds his work fascinating.
                    Arthur notably wields a Glock 17, and on one occasion an FN SCAR-L assault rifle. <br> He is portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His Totem is a red loaded die. Gordon-Levitt asserts: <i>“Arthur is the organized one, the one making sure everything is in its right place. The way I see it, Cobb is the artist and Arthur is the producer.”</i>

                    Ariadne is a graduate student at the École d'Architecture in Paris. She was contacted by Dom Cobb for a specific job: to design three complete dream layer mazes on the Fischer <span style="color: red;">inception</span> job. Although
                    the job was dangerous, Ariadne was propelled by her intellectual curiosity which made her unable to pull herself away from such a unique opportunity. Her Totem is a slightly hollowed out bishop chess piece. She is portrayed by Elliot
                    Page. <br>Ariadne's name comes from the ancient Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. In the myth, Ariadne assisted the hero, Theseus, in the labyrinth of the Minotaur by using a ball of red thread to lead them out. The movie's version
                    of Ariadne accompanies Cobb through the labyrinth of his own subconscious and gives him the means to deal with the monster he's imprisoned there. That along with the fact that she wears red for the majority of the movie proves her
                    name to be quite apt.

                    Eames is an essential part of the secrecy and deceit within the dream world. Eames can project the image of anyone, essentially forging an identity as a literal physical manifestation. Combined with his ability to mirror other people's mannerisms and
                    behaviors, he is a very capable doppelganger. This skill comes in handy, and can help convince another person that whomever team needs him to be in order to aid their deception. He frequently uses a Heckler and Koch P2000 throughout
                    the first level defending the taxi and city warehouse from projections, a South African MGL grenade launcher and a SIG SG 552 assault rifle with custom arctic camouflage while planting charges in the hospital. He is also seen holding
                    a Beretta 92FS Inox in the poster. Eames' totem is a poker chip. He is portrayed by actor Tom Hardy.

                    given him the nickname of "The Tourist" because he has no specific expertise but yet is still able to use his financial influence to join Cobb's extraction team. He is portrayed by Ken Watanabe.

To allow the dreamers to enter the multi-level dream of the Fischer <span style="color: red;">inception</span>                    job he combines his drugs with a powerful sedative that keeps them "under", while still keeping the dream worlds somewhat stable. Only a falling sensation is able to wake the dreamers from the dream state while under the influence
                    of these drugs. He is portrayed by actor Dileep Rao. He uses a two-toned SIG Sauer P232 in an attempt to eliminate the one projection that got onto the bridge in the first level of the Fischer <span style="color: red;">Inception</span>                    Job.

                Robert Michael Fischer is the target of the job offered to Cobb and his team by Saito. His father, Maurice Fischer, is on his death bed, leaving Robert as the heir to his multi-billion dollar empire. Despite his vast wealth, Robert is riddled with all
                sorts of insecurities, as one might expect of someone who has lived his entire life in the shadow of a hugely powerful individual. Key among those insecurities is the fear of not living up to his father's standards, an insecurity which
                allows Dom the opportunity for <span style="color: red;">Inception</span>. Fischer is portrayed by actor Cillian Murphy.
